# quickjs-emscripten - v0.1.0b

# quickjs-emscripten

Module `quickjs-emscripten` wraps QuickJS, a modern Javascript interpreter
written in C, for usage from Typescript or Javascript. This allows evaluating
untrusted Javascript safely, or even building a plugin system.

```typescript
import { getInstance } from 'quickjs-emscripten'

async function main() {
  const QuickJS = await getInstance()
  const vm = QuickJS.createVm()

  const result = vm.evalCode(`"Hello " + "world!"`)
  if (result.error) {
    console.log('Execution failed:', vm.dump(result.error))
    result.error.dispose()
  } else {
    console.log('Success:', vm.dump(result.value))
    result.value.dispose()
  }

  vm.dispose()
}

main()
```

## Background

This was inspired by seeing https://github.com/maple3142/duktape-eval
[on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21946565) and Figma's
blogposts about using building a Javascript plugin runtime:

* [How [Figma] built the Figma plugin system](https://www.figma.com/blog/how-we-built-the-figma-plugin-system/): Describes the LowLevelJavascriptVm interface.
* [An update on plugin security](https://www.figma.com/blog/an-update-on-plugin-security/): Figma switches to QuickJS.

## Status

**Appears to work**, but lacks rigorous tests. Some functionality is excersized
in ts/examples/hello.ts.

Open problems:

* Think more about C -> JS function calls. Right now there is a fixed-size
  array for these pointers. Maybe we need to manage our own resizable array
  inside C code?

* Simplify memory management. Currently the user must call `handle.dispose()` on all handles they
  create to avoid leaking memory in C.

  * We chould use a Pool abstraction and do a Pool.freeAll() to free all handles and pointers
    in the pool.

  * Pools, etc, should not pollute QuickJSVm interface. Composition!

## Developing

This library is implemented in two languages: C and Typescript.

### The C parts

The ./c directory contains C code that wraps the QuickJS C library (in ./quickjs).
Public functions (those starting with `QTS_`) in ./c/interface.c are
automatically exported to native code (via a generated header) and to
Typescript (via a generated FFI class). See ./generate.ts for how this works.

The C code builds as both with `emscripten` (using `emcc`), to produce WASM (or
ASM.js) and with `clang`. Build outputs end up in ./build/wrapper/{wasm,native}.
Intermediate object files from QuickJS end up in ./build/quickjs/{wasm,native}.

You'll need to install `emscripten`. Following the offical instructions here, using `emsdk`:
https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html#installation-instructions

Related NPM scripts:

* `yarn update-quickjs` will sync the ./quickjs folder with a
  github repo tracking the upstream QuickJS.
* `yarn make-debug` will rebuild C outputs into ./build/wrapper
* `yarn run-n` builds and runs ./c/test.c

### The Typescript parts

The ./ts directory contains Typescript types and wraps the generated Emscripten
FFI in a more usable interface.

You'll need `node` and `npm` or `yarn`. Install dependencies with `npm install`
or `yarn install`.

* `yarn run-ts` runs an example file
* `yarn build` produces ./build/js
* `yarn watch` will watch ./ts for changes and build into ./build/js
